This program is designed to gather stock data from a stock 
exchange, sort that data, and then output the stocks based on 
which stock saw the most positive movement.

To preform this you will need a URL that directs to the location
of a downloadable CSV file. This file can be compressed or not.

Some forms of authentication are currently not accounted for 
namely, the authentication used in the NASDAQ so those files 
currently won't be usable.
